Atsy

Atsy is an ecommerce website for craft. It is inspired by Etsy. It is built on Rails and PostgreSQL backend with React and Redux frontend.

This project was built within a 10 days timeframe. I do plan on implementing new features on this project over time. Features for planned release:
  1. Search
  2. Categories
  3. User / Profile page
